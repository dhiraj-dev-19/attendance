Project: Face Attendance System with GUI

Description:
Developed a real-time facial recognition system that automates attendance tracking using Python and computer vision. The system identifies registered faces via webcam, logs entries in CSV format, and features a user-friendly GUI for live monitoring and status updates.

Key Features:

Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition

GUI interface with live webcam feed and system console (Tkinter)

Automatic attendance logging with timestamp and date

Duplicate entry prevention for same-day attendance

Easy setup with plug-and-play face registration (add images to known_faces folder)

Technical Stack:

Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, dlib, Tkinter

CSV for data storage, PIL for imageÂ processing
